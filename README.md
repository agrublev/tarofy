geolocation activated tarot reading app

<strong>STAGE 1</strong>
after some help from my teacher, the tarot button works to display a modal with a tarot card. 
further, I've searched for a way to implement an array of cards that would appear randomly using a random function. 
However, the cards seem to appear outside of the modal and next to the button rather than within the modal. 
currently troubleshooting to get the modal to display a random card without the card appearing in the background alongside the button. 

<strong>STAGE 2</strong>
after, making the button only appear within certain geolocations. the app is meant to be displayed on mobile. 

* newbie coder here, please excuse poor coding practices. fingers crossed on this working.
