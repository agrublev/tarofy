geolocation activated tarot readings

after some help from my teacher, the tarot button works to display a modal with a tarot card. 
further, I've searched for a way to implement an array of cards that would appear randomly using function. 
However, the cards seem to appear outside of the modal and next to the button rather than within the modal. 
currently troubleshooting to get the modal to display a random card without the card appearing in the background alongside the button. 

* newbie coder here, please excuse poor coding practices. fingers crossed on this working.
